Best USDC Solana APY
Goal is to create an automated service, which finds the lending protocol with best % APY for stablecoins (only USDC).
If the % APY changes and a better protocol is found after some time, automatically withdraw and deposit into the best.
Take into account that quick withdrawals and deposits periodically might lead to losses.

Lending protocol for this task: 
- marginfi
- kamino

Example:
App finds that Kamino’s USDC APY is 4% and the highest at the moment. App deposits there.
After a week, Kamino’s USDC drops to 3% and marginfi’s APY increases to 4.25%. App withdrawals from kamino and deposits in marginfi’s USDC.

Requirements:
Lending protocols: marginfi and kamino.finance
Stablecoin: only USDC
Create a Solana program, which:
owner can deposit USDC
owner can withdrawal USDC
integrates with Kamino’s deposit and withdraw functionality
integrates with marginfi’s deposit and withdraw token functionality
migration between lending protocols

  4. Create a Rust application, which:
has information of the USDC APY of both protocols.
has a simple logic on how to consider which is the best USDC APY farm between the two protocols.
integrates with 3.
triggers 3. on deposits, and migrates the USDC funds once there is a better opportunity than the current existing
